          Paragraphs are the group of sentences combined together, about a
          certain topic. It is a very important form of writing as we write
          almost everything in paragraphs, be it an answer, essay, story,
          emails, etc. We can say that a well-structured paragraph is the
          essence of good writing. The purposes of the paragraph are to give
          information, to explain something, to tell a story, and to convince
          someone that our idea is right. A topic sentence is a precise
          statement that reflects the main idea of the paragraph. It should be
          carefully written as it will show the reader what you are going to
          talk about. Words chosen for this should not be cluttered and
          ambiguous as readers will decide to read further based on this. It is
          not necessary to write the topic sentence at the beginning of the
          paragraph. It can be put anywhere, as long as it reflects the main
          topic. For instance, if you mention that you are going to talk about
          the advantages of using the hand sanitizer, then in supporting
          sentence you should only talk about advantages, not the features or
          anything else. 2. Supporting Sentences Supporting sentences explain
          the topic sentence in detail. They expand the main topic and develops
          the main idea into the explanation. They explain the main topic using
          examples, facts, quotes, etc. They have to be related to the topic
          sentence. There can be two types of Supporting sentences, First, The
          major supporting sentence; this sentence directly explains the main
          idea with some new fact or new idea. Second, minor support sentence
          helps the major supporting sentence develop the controlling idea. 3.
          Conclusion Sentence A good concluding sentence brings a paragraph to a
          polished end. It may give a summary of the main topic, a concluding
          sentence also gives a final take on the topic and leaves the reader
          with complete information. A good conclusion can either be just
          reiterating the topic again or it could be concluded with a few main
          points which were not exclusively mentioned in the paragraph. Example
          of a Paragraph- As you can see that the main idea of the paragraph was
          describing the room. Then there are many supporting sentences
          supporting the main idea and expanding it in a way that the picture
          becomes clear in the reader’s mind. Concluding sentence “ I felt that
          I breathed an atmosphere of sorrow. An air of stern, deep, and
          irredeemable gloom hung over and pervaded all,” This sentence
          summarised how the room looked and what feeling ran through his mind.
